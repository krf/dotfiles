Usage: $0 [-f] [-r] <user> <sha-1>...

git-note-review adds Reviewed-by: lines to the log messages of the
named commits. Commits can be specified as either as a single sha1 or
as a sha1_excl..sha1_incl range (see git rev-list).
If any <whatever>-by: tag with the specified <user> is found to be
already present in a given commit, the commit is skipped.
If -f is specified, the check whether the commits were already pushed
is omitted. This only makes sense if you are planning to make a forced
push.
If -r is specified, the named user's reviews are removed from the commits.
